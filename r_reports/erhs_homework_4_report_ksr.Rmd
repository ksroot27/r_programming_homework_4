## Unsolved Homicides in Baltimore

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

homicides <- read_csv("../data_raw/data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv")
head(homicides)

homicides <- homicides %>% 
  unite(city_name, city, state, sep = ", ")

unsolved <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(unsolved = disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_name) %>% 
  summarize(n_homicides = n(),
            n_unsolved = sum(unsolved))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
baltimore <- unsolved %>% 
  filter(city_name == "Baltimore, MD")

prop.test(x = baltimore$n_unsolved,
          n = baltimore$n_homicides)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
